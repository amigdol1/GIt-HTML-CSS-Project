					<p>This is a blog that overviews Alyn (pronounced "Allen"), a 2-year old, fun-loving golden and white shih tzu.  It covers her likes/dislikes as well as some of her favorite hobbies. Her owner, Alex may be a little biased, but she's still the <em><strong>best</strong></em> dog in the entire world. This page uses:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
					</ol>
					<p>If you're curious as to how adorable she is, check out her blog now!  It includes a pretty perfect photo of her.</p>

					<p>This project was used as an introduction to HTML.  It outlines the ins and outs of making a batch of cookies with a list of ingredients along with the baking instructions.  The format of this page includes ordered and unordered lists.  In this case, the site only uses HTML.</p>

					<p>One of Alex Migdol's most recent pieces of work as an introduction to Bootstrap. As part of the project, the page is intended to mimic a wikipedia page that already exists.  While the original page uses tables, this page uses grids for formatting.  This page uses the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>HTML</li>
							<li>CSS</li>
							<li>Bootstrap</li>
						</ol>

				<h3>About Alex</h3>
					<p>Alex graduated from the University of Oregon in 2011 majoring in Business and Psychology.  Shortly after, she landed a job working at a mobile app company in the Client Services Department.  While she enjoyed interacting with people and planning out various projects, she was looking to get more involved within the development process. After a couple of years, Alex started working in the QA department, where she creates tests plans and tests new features.  She tries to find as many bugs as possible before any of the cleints who use the product do. Some of her hobbies include, but are not limited to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Eating</li>
							<li>Drinking</li>
							<li>Teaching her dog new tricks</li>
							<li>Camping</li>
							<li>Taking "Intro to Programming"</li>
						</ul>
