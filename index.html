					<p>This is a blog that overviews Alyn (pronounced "Allen"), a 2-year old, fun-loving golden and white shih tzu.  It covers her likes/dislikes as well as some of her favorite hobbies. Her owner, Alex may be a little biased, but she's still the <strong>best</strong> dog in the entire world. This page uses:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you're curious as to how adorable she is, check out her blog now!  It includes a pretty perfect photo of her.</p>

					<p>This project was used as an introduction to HTML.  It outlines the ins and outs of making a batch of cookies with a list of ingredients along with the baking instructions.  The format of this page includes ordered and unordered lists.  In this case, the site only uses HTML.</p>

					<div class="col-md-12"><h4><a href="https://github.com/amigdol1/bootstrap_wiki">Wikipedia</a></div>
					<p>One of Alex Migdol's most recent pieces of work as an introduction to Bootstrap. As part of the project, the page is intended to mimic a wikipedia page that already exists.  While the original page uses tables, this page uses grids for formatting.  This page uses the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML</li>
							<li>CSS</li>
							<li>Bootstrap</li>
						</ul>
